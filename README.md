## Versioning

Unless otherwise noted, JRAW-Android's version is the same as JRAW. So JRAW-Android v1.1.0 would use JRAW v1.1.0.

## Contributing

This project uses Robolectric for unit tests. Linux and Mac users on Android Studio should see [this](http://robolectric.org/getting-started/#note-for-linux-and-mac-users) when running tests through the IDE.
